            <p>I'm Joan, in my final year of studying Computer Science to obtain my Bachelor's degree. I've had the opportunity to develop my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science through the projects I've undertaken, whether they were academic, during internships, or most recently, during my apprenticeship. Over time and through various projects, I've gravitated towards the web aspect of computer science, as well as the potential for advancement in this field. </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Apprenticeship</h2>
        <p class="context-work-study">During my final year of Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Clermont-Ferrand, from 2023 to 2024, I had the opportunity to undertake a one-year apprenticeship. 
            This period was extremely enriching both professionally and personally. 
            I was involved in the development of an application called PINK, which functions as a data checker for repositories containing erroneous or duplicate information. 
            The main objective was to provide a user-friendly tool for users to link directories present in the data lake to the PINK application, and then import, modify, and delete repositories as needed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="context-work-study">
            To ensure data quality in the repositories, the application was designed with structures following the repository principle, including column names and expected data types. 
            Additionally, the principle of composite keys was implemented, allowing the user to choose the columns they wish to check to ensure data uniqueness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="context-work-study">
            This project was a comprehensive experience, involving application development, system programming, data manipulation, and teamwork.
        </p>

        <div class="Apprenticeship-container">
            <div class="Apprenticeship-box">
                <div class="Apprenticeship-info">
                    <h4>Development of an Application</h4>
                    <p>For this development part, I had the opportunity to create an application from scratch. The technologies used were Django, a Python framework,
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. I learned how to use these technologies and implement them to create a web application.
                        Through this experience, I gained a solid understanding of modern web technologies and how they come together to create powerful and intuitive applications.

                <div class="Apprenticeship-info">
                    <h4>System Programming</h4>
                    <p>I was less involved in the system part, but we had to deploy the application so that it was only available to the client's employees.
                        To do this, we set up a CI/CD part with GitLab and Docker. This allowed us to deploy the application on a server and update it easily.
                        We also used Grafana to monitor the performance of the application and the database.

                <div class="Apprenticeship-info">
                    <h4>Data Usage</h4>
                    <p>To set up this application, it was important to be able to manipulate data, especially repositories and directories in the data lake.
                        So, I had to learn how to manipulate this data, import, modify, and delete it. I also had to learn how to check it to ensure data quality.
                        For this, I had to verify that the data was unique and that it met the expected criteria.

                    <h4>Teamwork</h4>
                    <p>During this project, I was a member of a team of five people, including myself.
                        Our roles were diversified: some specialized in data, others in operations, and some had more versatile skills.
                        Despite the differences in profiles, I integrated well into this team that already existed when I arrived. The atmosphere was very pleasant, which allowed us to work in good conditions.
                        For our organization and progress on the project, we adopted the agile SCRUM methodology.

                        I played this sport for only one year when I was 6 years old, however, I realized that it wasn't the practice that interested me. <br>
                        Instead, I enjoy watching football matches on television or at the stadium. <br>
                        Indeed, my weekends are often filled with football matches from various leagues. <br>
                        Being from Clermont, I am a big supporter of Clermont Foot 63, but also of Paris Saint-Germain. <br>

                        I like to stay informed about the latest developments in the field of computer science and new technologies. <br>
                        This allows me to stay up to date on the technologies used in the computer science field and to be able to use them in my projects. <br>

                        I have had the opportunity to travel to several countries in Europe, which has allowed me to discover new cultures, languages, and ways of life. <br>
                        I hope to continue traveling and discovering new places around the world. <br>
                        In the future, I would love to visit the United States, Iceland, and Japan. <br>
